# LiquiDeFi

## introduction

liquiDefi is an **unaudited** project for ETHglobal Hackmoney.

This product aims to pool users Dai in order the provide funds to our liquidation bot to carry out liquidations on mainnet. To start our bot will only be running against the aave platform. 

Users depositing Dai are minted sharkDai. By holding sharkDai you are exposed to the profits of the liquidation bot in proportion to your percentage of the pool.

Anyone holding sharkDai can manually call liquidations on any platform using these pooled funds to carry out that function. This is only permissible if the pool will receive more Dai than what was taken out within the same block.

## more information
Liquidations on DeFi platforms as a means of making money used to be quite inaccessible to a majority of DeFi enthusiasts, while the yields they can offer are very attractive. We aim to combat this by allowing anyone to participate in DeFi liquidations.

LiquiDefi is a profit-sharing platform for liquidations. Users deposit Dai into our pool and are minted sharkTokens. These tokens represent a percentage of the total pool holdings and increase in value as liquidations are carried out. 

The pooled funds are utilised by our liquidation bots on Aave. By using the pooled assets vs flash loans we save in gas cost and are more efficient. This also will give everyday users the chance to profit from liquidation yields.
